# On the Bank

On the bank is an interactive map of Britain's rivers. Attached to each river is all relevant angling information.

The aim is to make it easier for new anglers to find local angling clubs to help them get started, and to allow existing anglers to find their next adventure, as well as to promote responsible and safe angling.

The application is currently in its very early stages, so we are still testing which technologies are best suited, however an example using the following technologies can be seen below:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript/Leaflet.js
- Python
- Django/GeoDjango
- QGIS
- PotsgreSQL/PostGIS
