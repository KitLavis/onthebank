# On the Bank

On the bank is an interactive map of Britain's rivers. Attached to each river is all relevant angling information.

The aim is to make it easier for new anglers to find local angling clubs to help them get started, and to allow existing anglers to find their next adventure, as well as to promote responsible and safe angling.

A number of filtering options will be available for the interactive map, including county, angling association, species of fish and so on.

The application is currently in its very early stages, so we are still testing which technologies are best suited, however the current stack is as follows:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript/Leaflet.js
- Python
- Django/GeoDjango
- QGIS
- PotsgreSQL/PostGIS
